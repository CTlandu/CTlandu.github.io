Hi there. This is my personal website. I'm currently a Junior at <a href='https://www.wm.edu/'>College of William & Mary</a> pursuing B.S. in Computer Science. I'm orginally from Shenzhen, China, which is a city just right next to Hong Kong (everyone knows Hong Kong huh), and curretly living in Williamsburg, Virginia.

As a Computer Science student, I am self-motivated and goal-oriented. I'm currently working on two on-campus research with Professor. Yuan Yuting from the Department of Data Science. Too see the research project, click [Publications](/publications).

In my spare time, I'm a photographer and video creator. 
This website serves to show my academic & career & photography progress and works.

For Photography Works: See [Photography](/photography) or  my [Instagram Page](https://www.instagram.com/ctphotography77/)

Here is my <a href="/assets/pdf/Colin_Tang_Resume.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a> for academics and works.

Fun fact of me: 
I share the same last name with my mom.

I withdrew from William & Mary in 2020 due to the Covid-19 and attended [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHKSZ)](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en). During the 2-year study at CUHKSZ, I continued studying Computer Science, explored other opportunities such as being a video creator, photographer, and peer mental counselor. Those were valuable experiences to me.

I came back to William & Mary in 2022 and planned to graduate in 2025.
