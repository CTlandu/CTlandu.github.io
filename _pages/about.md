Hi there. This is my personal website. I'm currently a Junior at <a href='https://www.wm.edu/'>College of William & Mary</a> majoring in Computer Science. 
I'm also a photographer and video creator. 
This website serves to show my academic/career/photography progress and works.

Photography Works: [Photography](/photography) or check my [Instagram Page](https://www.instagram.com/ctphotography77/)

My <a href="/assets/pdf/Colin_Tang_Resume.pdf" target="_blank">Resume</a>.

Fun fact of me: 
I share the same last name with my mom.

I withdrew from William & Mary in 2020 due to the Covid situation and attended a non-degree program at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHKSZ)](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en). During the 2-year study at CUHKSZ, I continued studying Computer Science, explored other opportunities such as being a video creator, photographer, and peer mental counselor. Those were valuable experiences to me.

I came back to William & Mary in 2022. I plan to graduate in 2025.
