Hi there. This is my personal website. I'm currently a sophomore student at <a href='https://www.wm.edu/'>College of William & Mary</a> majoring Computer Science. I'm also a photographer in the making. This website serves to show my academic/career/photography progress.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://wm.edu). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
